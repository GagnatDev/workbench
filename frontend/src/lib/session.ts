/**
 * Session handling with the homectl-auth-proxy sidecar: the browser holds only
 * the sidecar's opaque `hs_session` cookie, and the SPA never sees a token. The
 * sidecar refreshes the upstream OAuth token in-cluster while that cookie is
 * valid, so an API `401` means the *session itself* is gone and the only fix is
 * a top-level navigation that reaches the sidecar (letting it silently
 * re-authenticate against the central login when the IdP session is still
 * alive, or redirect to login when it is not).
 *
 * The goal is for that re-authentication to be invisible: a `401` triggers one
 * place-preserving full load, the sidecar re-establishes the session, and the
 * user lands back where they were. The session-expired screen only appears when
 * repeated attempts fail (no sidecar in front / IdP session also gone), and a
 * hard attempt cap guarantees we never reload-loop.
